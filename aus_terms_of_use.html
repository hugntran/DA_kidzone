                    of Service (the "Agreement"), and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in our

                <p><strong>A note about Student Data:</strong> This Service may be purchased by providers of educational
                    services, such as schools, school districts, or teachers (collectively referred to as "Schools")
                    that use our services for educational purposes. When ABCya contracts with a School to provide the

                    School or by the student. We consider such Student Data to be strictly confidential and in general
                    do not use such data for any purpose other than improving and providing our Services to the School
                    or on the school's behalf. Our collection, use and sharing of Student Data is governed by this
                    Agreement and any applicable laws and regulations including, in the U.S., provisions of the Family
                    Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"), the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA")

                    acts or omissions.</p>
                <p>ABCya.com accounts may not be shared by more than one person or organization unless express
                    authorization is given by ABCya.</p>
                <p>ABCya does not sell the Service to children, but only to adults who can purchase the Service with a
                    credit card or other permitted payment method. If you are under eighteen (18) years of age, you may
                    use the Service only with the involvement and consent of a parent, legal guardian, or at the
                    direction of your School. Your School may impose additional policies regarding the use of the
                    Service, with which you must comply.</p>
                <p>If you open an ABCya account to provide the Service to students in a School, you represent and
                    warrant that you are an authorized representative of the School with the authority to bind the
                    School to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the School's behalf. If you
                    contact ABCya to take any action with respect to an account, you represent and warrant that you have
                    all necessary authority to request such action(s) from or on behalf of the account-holder (e.g., a
                    School or Parent).</p>
                <p>The U.S. Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that online service
                    providers obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children
                    under 13. If you are a School providing the Service to children under 13, you represent and warrant
                    that you have the authority to provide consent on behalf of parents for ABCya to collect information
                    from students under 13 before allowing such students to access our Service. We recommend that all
                    Schools provide appropriate disclosures to students and parents regarding their use of service
                    providers such as ABCya and that they provide a copy of our Privacy Policy and the Student Data
                    Privacy Pledge to parents.</p>

                <p>This Section applies to a School's use of the Service.</p>
                <p>When ABCya is used by a School for an educational purpose, ABCya may collect or have access to
                    Student Data that is provided by the School or by a student. "Student Data" is personal information
                    that is directly related to an identifiable student and may include "educational records" as defined
                    by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA").</p>
                <p>The School or the student, and not ABCya, owns and controls the Student Data. You authorize ABCya to
                    access, collect, transmit, modify, display and store Student Data to provide the Service and as
                    described in this Agreement and in our Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p><u><strong>Compliance with Laws.</strong></u> In the U.S., ABCya may collect and process Student Data
                    as a School Official with a legitimate educational interest pursuant to the Family Educational
                    Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"), 20 U.S.C. § 1232(g). Individually and collectively, we and our
                    School Users agree to uphold our obligations under FERPA, COPPA, the Protection of Pupil Rights
                    Amendment ("PPRA"), applicable State laws relating to student data privacy, and with all other laws
                    and regulations governing the protection of Student Data.</p>
                <p><u><strong>Use of Student Data.</strong></u> By submitting, providing us access to, or causing us to
                    receive Student Data, you agree that ABCya may use the Student Data for the purposes of (i)
                    providing the Service, (ii) improving and developing our Service, (iii) enforcing our rights under
                    these Terms, and (iv) as permitted with the School's or the User's consent.</p>
                <p><u><strong>Use of De-Identified or Anonymized Student Data.</strong></u> You agree that both before
                    and after the term of the Agreement, ABCya may collect, analyze, use, and retain data derived from
                    Student Data as well as data about users' access and use of the Service, for the purpose of
                    operating, analyzing, improving or marketing the Service, developing new products or services,
                    conducting research or other purposes, provided that ABCya may not share or publicly disclose
                    information that is derived from Student Data unless such data is de-identified and/or anonymized
                    such that it cannot reasonably identify a specific individual.</p>
                <p><u><strong>Use of Personal Information for Marketing.</strong></u> You agree that ABCya may provide
                    customized content, advertising, and commercial messaging to school, teacher or district
                    administrative users and other non-student users from time to time, provided that such
                    advertisements shall not be based on Student Data. For emphasis, and without limitation, ABCya shall
                    never use Student Data to engage in targeted advertising.</p>
                <p><u><strong>Disclosure of Student Data and Third-Party Service Providers.</strong></u> You acknowledge
                    and agree that ABCya may provide access to Student Data to our employees and service providers which
                    have a legitimate need to access such information to provide their services to us. We and our
                    employees, affiliates, service providers, or agents involved in the handling, transmittal, and
                    processing of Student Data will be required to maintain the confidentiality of such data. ABCya
                    shall not share Student Data with third parties other than as described in this Agreement and in the
                    ABCya Privacy Policy, or with consent of the School or parent.</p>
                <p><u><strong>Student Data Access and Deletion Requests.</strong></u> You may request that we delete
                    Student Data in our possession at any time by providing such a request in writing, and we shall
                    comply with such request within thirty (30) days, except that ABCya shall not be required to delete
                    Student Data that has been moved to a personal family account on the Service or as otherwise
                    prohibited by law. A parent or student over the age of 18 seeking to access, modify, correct, or
                    delete personal information in a student account that is connected to a School account will be
                    instructed to contact the School to discuss data deletion or modification. ABCya is not required to
                    delete data that has been derived from Student Data if such data is de-identified and/or anonymized
                    such that it cannot reasonably identify a specific individual.</p>
                <p><u><strong>Data Security and Breach Notification.</strong></u> We have implemented administrative,
                    physical and technical safeguards designed to secure the personal information in ABCya's possession
                    and control from unauthorized access, disclosure and use. If an unauthorized party gains access to
                    or has been disclosed Student Data (a "Security Event"), that we have collected or received through
                    the Service under this Agreement, we will promptly notify the School. If, due to a Security Event
                    which is caused by the acts or omissions of ABCya or its agents, a notification to an individual,
                    organization or government agency is required under applicable privacy laws, the School shall be
                    responsible for the timing, content, and method of any such legally-required notice and compliance
                    with such laws and ABCya shall indemnify the School for reasonable costs related to legally-required
                    notifications. With respect to any Security Event which is not caused by the acts or omissions of
                    ABCya or its agents, ABCya shall reasonably cooperate with School's investigation of the Security
                    Event, as School requests, at School's reasonable expense, but ABCya shall not indemnify a School
                    for costs associated with the Security Event. ABCya shall be responsible for the timing, content,
                    cost and method of notice and compliance with such laws as they relate to users that are not
                    associated with a School account.</p>
                <p><u><strong>State Specific Terms.</strong></u> The following additional terms may apply depending on
                    the state a School is located:</p>
                <p><strong>5.1 Connecticut</strong></p>
                <p>This Section 5.1 applies to the use of the Service by Schools located in the State of Connecticut.
                    The purpose of this Section 5.1 is to document compliance with applicable Connecticut state laws
                    that may apply to the use of the Service by Schools in Connecticut, such as Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. §
                    10-234aa-dd. This Section 5.1 incorporates by reference the definitions set forth in Conn. Gen.
                    Stat. Ann. § 10-234aa.</p>
                <p>If you open an ABCya account to provide the Service to students in a School located in the State of
                    Connecticut, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so on behalf of the local or
                    regional board of education with authority over the School and that you are authorized to
                    communicate with ABCya on behalf of the local or regional board of education.</p>
                <p>ABCya and you shall comply with all applicable sections of Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 10-234aa-dd. The
                    following terms shall apply as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 10-234bb. To the extent that any
                    such required terms conflict with other terms in this Agreement, the terms of this Section 5.1 shall
                    apply.</p>

                        student records or student-generated content in the possession of ABCya by sending a request to
                        <a href="mailto:support@abcya.com">support@ABCya.com</a>. As permitted by Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann.
                        § 10-234bb(2), ABCya is not required to delete information prohibited from deletion or required
                        to be retained under state or federal law or stored as a copy as part of a disaster recovery
                        storage system and that is (i) inaccessible to the public, and (ii) unable to be used in the
                        normal course of business by the contractor. ABCya will, however, comply with requests for
                        deletion of student information, student records, or student-generated content that is restored
                        from such disaster recovery storage systems.

                        contained in student information, student records or student-generated content and correct
                        erroneous information, if any, in such student record by contacting their School. ABCya will
                        respond to such requests in accordance with instructions sent by an authorized School
                        representative to <a href="mailto:support@abcya.com">support@ABCya.com</a>.</li>
                    <li>ABCya will take actions designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of student
                        information, student records and student-generated content.</li>

                        provisions of section 10-234dd when there has been an unauthorized release, disclosure or
                        acquisition of student information, student records or student-generated content.</li>

                    purpose of this Section 5.2 is to document compliance with New York state laws that may apply to the
                    use of the Service by Schools in New York, such as New York State Education Law Section 2-d (Ed Law
                    2-d) and Part 121 of Title 8 of the Codes, Rules and Regulations of the State of New York (8 CRR-NY

                <p>If you open an ABCya account to provide the Service to students in a School located in the State of
                    New York, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so on behalf of the educational

                        ABCya Service as set forth in this Agreement. Student data and teacher or principal data will
                        not be used for any other purpose.</li>

                        destroyed) – This Agreement will be in effect for a School so long as that School has an active
                        subscription to the ABCya Service. Upon expiration or termination of a School's subscriptions
                        without renewal, ABCya will delete student data and teacher or principal data in accordance with
                        the terms of any applicable written agreement with the School, written requests from authorized
                        School administrators, and our standard data retention schedule. Authorized School

                    <li>8 CRR-NY § 121.3(c)(4) if and how a parent, student, eligible student, teacher or principal may
                        challenge the accuracy of the student data or teacher or principal data that is collected –
                        Parents, students, eligible students, and teachers or principals may contact their School to
                        exercise this right. ABCya will cooperate with the School to effectuate such requests at the
                        School's direction.</li>
                    <li>8 CRR-NY § 121.3(c)(5) where the student data or teacher or principal data will be stored,
                        described in such a manner as to protect data security, and the security protections taken to

                        and at rest – ABCya will utilize a technology or methodology specified or permitted by the
                        Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services in guidance issued under
                        section 13402(H)(2) of Public Law 111-5.</li>

                        access – ABCya periodically provides training to its employees regarding data security and
                        privacy obligations with respect to such data.</li>

                        information is protected – While ABCya does not sub-contract portions of any particular contract
                        with a customer, ABCya does utilize vendors in the course of providing the ABCya Service. Such
                        vendors will only be provided personally identifiable information to the extent necessary for
                        them to provide their contracted-for services and will be subject to obligations of
                        confidentiality and security consistent with this Section 5.2.</li>
                    <li>8 CRR-NY § 121.6(a)(6) specify how the third-party contractor will manage data security and
                        privacy incidents that implicate personally identifiable information including specifying any

                        agency – ABCya will manage and respond to Security Events as set forth in Section 5 of this
                        Agreement and Section 8 of the Privacy Policy. As required by Ed Law 2-d, ABCya will notify the
                        school of a Security Event in the most expedient way possible and without unreasonable delay.
                    </li>
                    <li>8 CRR-NY § 121.6(a)(7) describe whether, how and when data will be returned to the educational
                        agency, transitioned to a successor contractor, at the educational agency's option and
                        direction, deleted or destroyed by the third-party contractor when the contract is terminated or
                        expires – Upon expiration or termination of a School's subscriptions without renewal, ABCya will
                        delete student data and teacher or principal data in accordance with the terms of any applicable
                        written agreement with the School, written requests from authorized School administrators, and
                        our standard data retention schedule. Authorized School administrators may contact ABCya at <a

                <p>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS
                    THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM ABCYA. For any dispute with ABCya, you agree to first
                    contact us at <a href="mailto:support@abcya.com">support@abcya.com</a> and attempt to resolve the
                    dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that ABCya has not been able to resolve a dispute
                    it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy
                    (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or
                    in connection with or relating to this agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof
                    (collectively, "Claims"), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration
                    Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at <a
                        rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.jamsadr.com/">www.jamsadr.com</a>. The arbitration
                    will be conducted in San Mateo County, California, unless you and ABCya agree otherwise. If you are
                    a School or are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying
                    any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award
                    rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and
                    reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for
                    non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case,
                    unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the
                    arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney's fees, and your
                    reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of
                    competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your
                    commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered
                    by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section
                    shall be deemed as preventing ABCya from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the
                    courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation
                    of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.</p>
